# Disver
A forum peer with decentralization in mind. This project aims to achieve secure, reliable, pure forum that powered by P2P network without any opinionated dependency.

# Acknowledgement
In decentralized system, we don't use the term "client" and "server". Instead, we use "peer" or "node" and it implies for everyone who involved in the network. Although, every node isn't always doing the same thing in the network. For example, there are peers who help the network stability like providing the data mirror  (with incentive) and there are also peers that only sending message or just hanging around.

# But why, though?
Nowadays, Web3 is mostly seen as cryptocurrency-related stuff, or gambling, or some any illegal activity. Although this technology is still on a state where "solution looking for problem", it's good to see it from different perspective, and doing the simple real-world example that might bootstraps into bigger thing.<br>

The commitment to not use opinionated dependency (like libp2p) is to push ourselves to not just knowing what it is but also knowing how does it work under the hood.<br>
